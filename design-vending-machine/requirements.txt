Vending Machine – Low Level Design Requirements

Functional Requirements
1. The vending machine should allow users to select products.
2. The vending machine should validate product availability.
3. The vending machine should calculate total price based on selected items.
4. The vending machine should support multiple payment methods (UPI, Card, Wallet).
5. The vending machine should dispense items after successful payment.
6. The vending machine should allow cancellation before payment.
7. The vending machine should prevent invalid operations based on current state.
8. Inventory should be updated only after successful payment.

Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system should be extensible to add new payment methods.
2. The system should avoid invalid state transitions.
3. The design should follow SOLID principles.
4. The system should be easy to test and maintain.
5. The design should model real-world vending machine behavior.

Constraints / Assumptions
1. Single user interacts with the machine at a time.
2. Inventory is managed locally (no distributed setup).
3. Payment is synchronous.
4. Inventory reservation is logical; consumption happens after payment.

Out of Scope
1. Distributed transactions
2. Refund processing after dispense
3. Multi-machine inventory synchronization
